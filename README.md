Testing
-------

Be sure to bundle your dependencies and then create a dummy test app for the specs to run against.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake test_app
bundle exec rspec spec
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_bootstrap/factories'
```
